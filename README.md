I thought that this article was really interesting because it illustrates a massive problem in software engineering today. Despite fantastic advancements in devops as a field, gigantic codebases at legacy firms are still powered by relatively old tech stacks. This got me really interested in learning more about the solutions for these types of problems and startups that are looking to reduce other forms of tech debt.
