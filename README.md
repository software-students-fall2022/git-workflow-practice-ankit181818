I thought that this article was really interesting because it illustrates a massive problem in software engineering today. Despite fantastic advancements in devops as a field, gigantic codebases at legacy firms are still powered by relatively old tech stacks. This got me really interested in learning more about the solutions for these types of problems and startups that are looking to reduce other forms of tech debt. 

### Comment from Brandon Chao

When I first encountered software engineering, I had always associated it with tech giants like Microsoft and Google. Those companies have a more "modern" feel to them, but the majority of companies are not necessarily integrated into the modern tech age. A lot of that tech world might be built entirely upon archaic systems and that might be a problem going forward.
